# Complic
A Very Complicate C++ Library from a POV of a Math Noob

# Why does this exist

I wanted to create a sort of challanging library for programmers to use

> This is a **coding challange**

# Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "Complic.h"

int main()
{
	Math m;
	int num = m._expnd(2, 2);
	std::cout << num << std::endl;
	system("pause");
	return 0;
}
```
